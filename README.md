# Custom-Password-Generator

The assignment was to make a password generator with specific rules. - user be asked for specific characters - has a character length of 8 - 128 - Make sure button generation displays user wants/requirements

The URL below is were I was able get a lot of help for this assignment. I understand the code is from this video but the way I was originally going is the same way this video went.

Little chagnes were made from my original of doing it and below is list:

    - I started to do arrays for the characters like in the video but this video helped me understand to seperate the character
    - cofirm the prompt instead of telling the user to write a 0 for yes and 1 for no seem more efficient for prompt and less time writing if statements
    - The video also helped me understand to add the confirmations to the arrays and using only one for loop instad of several at once

    *All in all it was a lot of help and I was able to do what I wanted originally in a clean compact way.
